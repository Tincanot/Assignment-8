# Assignment 8

![The original vizualization](bad_visualization.webp)

### Creating the first table with data from data.csv

```{r}
#adding the needed libraries
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#inserting the contents of data.scv into a table
data_table <- read.table(
  text = "
  Demographics;Israel;Palestine;Both;Neither
  Registered Voters;0,291;0,214;0,197;0,298
  Republicans;0,471;0,126;0,149;0,254
  Democrats;0,171;0,319;0,213;0,297
  Independents;0,201;0,201;0,238;0,36
  Republicans  18-29;0,279;0,334;0,135;0,252
  America First  25-29;0,245;0,408;0,041;0,306",
  sep = ";",
  dec = ",",
  #the first verse contains the names of the colums
  header = TRUE,
  #string must be a char type
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#chance to check if the table is correct
head(data_table)
```

### Conversion of the table to long format

```{r}
#conversion to long version (on which a plot can be based)
data_long <- data_table %>%
  pivot_longer(
    #all column without "Demographics"
    cols = -Demographics,
    #creating the "Position" category
    names_to = "Position",
    values_to = "Percent"
  ) %>%
  #calculating the data so it can be shown as percents
  mutate(Percent = Percent * 100)

head(data_long)
```

### Creation of the ggplot

I strived to recreate a clustered column chart from my Assignment-6. 

![My version of the visualization](Column_chart.png)

It is the least illegible version of it. 

```{r}
#creating a ggplot (differentiating color of the column by "Position")
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Demographics, y = Percent, fill = Position)) +
  #creating a clustered column chart
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  #adding cosmetics (additional texts)
  geom_text(aes(label = Percent), 
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), 
            vjust = -0.5) +
  #addition for easier visuals
  theme_minimal()
  
```
